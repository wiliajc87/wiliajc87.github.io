      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>I think I have a much better understanding of responsive design and how it works now. Luckily, I was already using percentages instead of pixels for my placement and sizes, so that isn't a conversion I'll have to mentally make--though I am going to have to run through my personal site pages and make sure I've been consistent.</p>
      <p>I'm excited to add media queries to my personal site's CSS--they're a bit frustrating at first, but super cool to see in action. I felt like this exercise left a few things unexplained, or maybe I should say underexplained, but having to search and find the answers on our own (And hacking away at things to see what worked) taught us a lot as well.</p>
