         <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
          <p>Pair programming is a method of devoloping websites, software, applications, games, and basically anything else your hear desires--so long as you're coding. But hey--the concepts could even be applied to other kinds of projects--so listen up!</p>
          <p>You and a buddy (We'll call this buddy <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Itispat.jpg">Pat</a>) are working on a project together. The old school way of doing this would be for you and Pat to talk about the project, and then one of you (Probably Pat--they're very dedicated) going to their desk and working for a few hours on it. Then Pat calls you over to check it out. But wow--Pat has made some mistakes--mistakes you would have caught if you'd been there while they were working! And what about that stuff at the end? It's just...that's not where this was supposed to go. Come on, Pat!</p>
          <p>This is what pair programming stops--with one of you acting as a the driver and one as the navigator (Explanation of those terms below) you can work together to avoid those kinds of problems. That means you've gotta work as a team and communicate what you're thinking--but that's a good thing! It cuts down the time it takes to make your product, and (if you're doing it well) protects you from the project going off in a weird direction one of you wasn't intending.</p>

         <h2>Pair Programming at Dev Bootcamp</h2>
         <p>At Dev Bootcamp, we're very serious about pair programming. Like, <a href="http://laurahouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/serious-cat.jpg">really serious</a>.</p>
         <p>Why? Because not only is pair programming a really smart way to work in general--it's genius to be doing it when you're learning. Maybe Pat is a little confused about how the Box Model works (Freakin' Pat--<a href="http://wiliajc87.github.io/blog-posts/week2_technical.html">I already told you about that</a>) and you're got that stuff on lock-down. Awesome--so you can share that info. Maybe, for no explainable reason, Pat is STUPIDLY good at finding cool fonts from external sources. See, now you're working together--and that's a beautiful thing.</p>
         <p>Achieving cool stuff AND learning? Sounds too good to be true--but this is the real deal. It works--and that's why DBC teaches it.</p>

    <div id="comparison">
        <h2>Driver and Navigator?</h2>
        <p>So, I used those terms earlier--driver and navigator. "What's that about?", I hear you asking. I mean, not literally. But I can guess. I'm a good guesser.</p>
        <p>It's pretty simple--you and Pat shouldn't constantly be fighting over who is using the keyboard--that's silly and it's going to slow you down. So, the Driver is the guy or gal running the keyboard--they type everything out. They're the <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100129155042/starwars/images/0/01/Hansoloprofile.jpg">Han</a> of the situation. The Navigator is <a href="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080815045819/starwars/images/7/73/Chewbaccaheadshot.jpg">Chewie</a>. Except, you know, without the constant screaming in a language no one understands. Navigators must speak the same language as their Driver. And not threaten to rip people's arms out.</p>
        <p>The Navigator is the one making sure everything is staying on course--they're watching for potential problems, they're keeping an eye on syntax, they're on the ready to make the Driver take a break if they start trying to eat the keyboard out of frustration with a function that JUST WON'T WORK! Navigators are important.</p>
        <p>Drivers, on the other hand, should keep their mind (mostly) focused on the immediate issue. Grinding out that <a href="http://now-here-this.timeout.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/url-71.gif">sweet, sweet code</a>.</p>

      <h2>Personal Reflection on Pairing</h2>
        <p>I've never felt that I was very good at working on a team. When I was a kid, I hated team sports, because I didn't want to lose because of someone else. And I didn't want to be responsible for other people's failure.</p>
        <p>Pairing on DBC projects have taught me that this is a dumb mentality. It's self-defeating and limiting. It is highly unlikely that you can ever achieve as much on your own as you can with the added power of another person's insight, intelligence, and skills.</p>
        <p>Pairing makes you better--because it makes you more than just yourself. I realize now that my mentality was limited--and pessimistic. It's time to move past that.</p>
