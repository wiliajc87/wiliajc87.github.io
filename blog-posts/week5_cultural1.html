<p>*Note--if you're not familiar with the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>, you should probably do a little reading--or you're gonna be confused. Besides, you'll be reading about something that's pretty awesome.</p>
<h2>--SO MANY FEELINGS!</h2>
<p>Anyone who's ever worked on any kind of team, be it for school, sports or in an underground drag racing crew, knows that it can inspire some pretty intense feelings. While working through Phase 0 of <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DBC</a>, I've been fortunate enough to pair program with some stupidly awesome people. They're smart, savvy, and dare I say it--<a href="http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/6864/1-1/mens-nerdy-nerd-costume.jpg">attractive</a>? Joking aside--DBC has done a crazy good job of bringing together a bunch of people who are great to work with.</p>
<p>But pair programming inspires some pretty intense emotions, no matter who you work with. This is partly because it's practically impossible for you and your partner to be of the exact same skill level. This week , I have worked in two different scenarios that inspired some pretty different emotions.</p>
<h2>--When you're the one ahead</h2>
<p>I want to start by noting--I am by no means suggesting that I'm better or smarter than the person I was working with (We're gonna call them <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0onXBUDbyRw/Uha54E5GLfI/AAAAAAAAlfM/X68u6TNTBaI/s1600/batman.jpg">Batman</a>--just to show how much I don't think I'm better than them). But in this specific scenario, I was better informed about how to work with a specific object-type in Ruby--so I was ahead of them and had to kind of take the lead on how to achieve a good solution to the challenge. I happened to bring the <a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/ac0916a98c78e15673e7c05075106131/tumblr_mpld8dMnae1sz2s7yo1_500.gif">shark repellent</a> that day, that's all I'm saying.</p>
<p>Being ahead of your pairing partner can be weird, because you don't want to come across as being a know-it-all. It's good for us (people learning programming) to struggle with things and figure it out. But at the same time, it's hard to not want to just take over--and that's <a href="http://dodgingcommas.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/exo1x_m-m0s9fgrmzvu9ja2.png">not cool</a>. So you've got to <a href="http://www.mycrazyrightwingbrother.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/large_spinal_tap_blu-ray2x.jpg">dial it down</a>. Because pairing isn't about you. It's about the team. And if that's hard for you to grasp, you'd better take a look in the mirror, friend. But not for too long. It could get <a href="http://www.scifimoviezone.com/imagematrix/matrix99065.jpg">weird</a>.</p>
<h2>--When you're the one behind</h2>
<p>Ever thought to yourself, "Ya know, I wish I REALLY understood the idea of being humble."? Well I've got the perfect slice of <a href="http://williambeem.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Humble-Pie.jpg">humble pie</a> for you!</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT--it is hard when you start to work on a challenge and the code you're trying to build looks like something from the <a href="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120403011728/creepypasta/images/0/0a/Ustino-necronomicon-2.jpg">Necronomicon</a> to you. And your partner totally knows what's up. It's like being <a href="http://springfieldpc.dyndns.org/shimmie/_images/a2a46b9b355eb275a24c9ba891dcf435/3092%20-%20matrix%20mouse%20tasty%20wheat.jpg">Mouse</a>. Sure, you've got a pretty bitchin' hat, but you're off in the corner talking about Tasty Wheat while your partner is off kung-fuing the crap out of the bad guys. It kinda sucks.</p>
<p>Or does it? This is the opportunity you really need (hint--I'm really talking to myself). You need to see someone who's got the topic on lock-down--because if they're a good pairing partner, they're going to share their knowledge with you. And if you're too busy <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y9U5rdP6wRk/UBWqmAZOJvI/AAAAAAAAAmg/-bbEzCI9imE/s1600/self+pity.jpg">wallowing in self-pity</a> to listen, you're missing out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow0lr63y4Mw">Stop it</a>.
