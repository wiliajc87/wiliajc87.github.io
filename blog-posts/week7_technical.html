      <p id="title">To SQL or Not to SQL?</p>
      <p id="date">10/11/2014</p>
      <div id="content">
        <p>This week at DBC, we're touching on SQL--and it's a pretty big shift in what we've been doing. SQL (and SQLite) is interesting in that you're not really "formatting" anything--at least we haven't been. We've been working with it in the terminal--so everything just looks like this:<br></p>

        <br>
        <p>Not that sexy, right? But pretty cool--because this is the kind of "under the hood" stuff that is going to go into making awesome Ruby apps eventually. Basically, SQL produces tables--and that's how it keeps the info you give it. I didn't tell it to make a table--that's just all it knows how to do. You can make multiple tables and then relate them to each other, but at the end of the day, you're always working with tables. It isn't exactly "fun".</p>
        <p>And, apparently, by learning SQL, I'm entering a conversation I wasn't aware of. The topic?</p>
        <h2>To SQL or Not to SQL.</h2>
        <p>Because there's also a movement called NoSQL--folks are (and have been for a while) making programs and languages that allow you to make databases without tables and without the SQL "language"--I use the word kind of lightly--it's not a language like Ruby is a language. But it is a means by which you communicate with something on your computer. So it's <em>kind of</em> a language.</p>
        <p>NoSQL databases are a little harder to explain--because they're all different. They were made in the spirit of breaking away from what WAS the standard. So, of course, things splinter a lot after that. And I think that's really cool. They (at least typically) don't use tables--some use a kind of hash form, some use a "document" format, and there's probably a lot more out there.</p>
        <p>People seems really devoted to one or the other--as they tend to be when talking about tech in general. It's funny to me how people can become so devoted to one thing or another. Their programming language of choice becomes a religion to them--and if you don't use their language, they want to convert you. Or disregard you. I'm not really down with that kind of mentality.</p>
        <p>Personally, I think it's wisest to choose what kind of database you're going to use based upon your project. Maybe you don't like SQL. But if SQL is the BEST choice for your project, use it anyway. I mean, what do you care about more? An arbitrary principal--or making the best possible project?</p>
        <p>I don't intend to let my preferences shade my ability to make the best possible product. If that means I have to learn a new tech, then I'll be all the better for it afterwards.</p>
        <p>So, I'm pretty psyched to learn what I can about NoSQL--but I'm not going to run to it just because SQL isn't very fun. That's silly.</p>
