      <p id="title">Yeah...What Was I Talking About?</p>
      <p id="date">10/26/2014</p>
      <div id="content">
<p>Tomorrow, I will be starting my on-campus time at DBC. I'm excited. I'm a little freaked. But mostly just excited. And one of the things we're looking at this week, because it will be so, so VERY important at DBC, is how to ask good questions.</p>
<p>There's an idea commonly spun around that there are no stupid questions. I don't buy it--I mean, I understand what the point of that is--You shouldn't feel stupid for having questions. And I agree with that--there's no reason to feel bad for having a question--that's natural. But to suggest that there's no such thing as a dumb question is to suggest that there are no dumb thoughts. Or dumb statements. And I'm sure we've all had/said some of those. <a href="http://i.lvme.me/sgl679d.jpg">Just me?</a></p>
<p>But if having questions is natural and perfectly fine, AND there ARE stupid questions, how does that work out? What makes a question stupid?</p>
<p>I would <a href="http://funnyand.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IamsohumbleItweetabouthowhumbleIam_20140331.jpg">humbly</a> suggest that a dumb question is one that requires the answerer of the question to do <em>unnecessary work</em>.</p>
<p>Does your question put the situation in perspective or are you just pointing and <a href="http://www.shalomlife.com/img/2014/09/25997/confused_baby_.jpg">looking confused</a>? Are you being specific about what you need? If you don't know enough to be specific, are you at least admitting that while asking the question?</p>
<p>There is a flow of logic that has to happen when you ask a question. There's a context. There's a path. And there's a specific thing you're wanting to know.</p>
<p>And it's <em>your</em> job to verbalize that stuff. It is <em>not</em> the job of the answerer to do all of those steps for you. That's crazy talk.</p>
<p>It's ALSO you job to keep your question concise. If your questions end up going like <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/b9/b94986c18e8f3a2753189b1e37fcdff7a986dfe0251a07aaba638b555afe7746.jpg">this</a>, you've got a problem. Get to the point. Hopefully in three sentences or less. Hopefully in one.</p>
<p>And I know--this seems like I'm just piling everything on the question asker. I am. It's your job.</p>
<p>The answerer <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NP8H8P7OHmw/U1Z4Y3DIBoI/AAAAAAAAdnI/TUtBKuwatlU/s1600/72541_830882756946042_1936131200_n.jpg">has enough to worry about</a>. They've gotta answer your (hopefully) well-asked question!</p>
