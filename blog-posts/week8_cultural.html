      <div id="content">
        <p><em>(Hint--the title was just an excuse to link to this <a href="http://luna.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b3d069e20191042f86ff970c-pi">awesome page from the Walking Dead comic</a>. SPOILER WARNING!)</em></p>
        <p>Oh, snap! It's time to talk about conflict. No, not <a href="http://kocosports.net/wp-content/uploads/wallpapers/ufc-kick-wallpaper_1280x720.jpg">this kind of conflict</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm talking about the more common kind of conflict--when you and another person just aren't clicking--maybe they were offended by something you said--maybe you don't like their work style--maybe they totally stole your <a href="http://i2.cdnds.net/12/23/618x971/pa-2818171.jpg">awesome fashion idea</a>. It happens.</p>
        <p>The question, of course, is what do we do when we face those kinds of things? It's never fun--but we've got deal with it--or it's gonna get worse. Rarely, if ever, do conflicts resolve themselves.</p>
        <p>I've been in the middle of this kind of thing before. A couple of years ago, I was a part of a group of people working on starting a new company--I won't go into specifics because they're not necessary. There were three of us who were really in charge of the big picture--see, we were merging two different groups together and things were pretty sensitive.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, the problem was between myself and another member of the three. We got along fine, but he and I had some pretty different values when it came to how we thought the business should be run. This was a creative business--and the problem of what kinds of products we would produce together was of the utmost importance.</p>
        <p>Things quickly devolved into political crap. It was lame. Terrible, really. I had some really ambitious ideas--ideas that I thought would make us distinct in our market and create interest.</p>
        <p>The other guy had a more mainstream view on what the company should produce that I thought was boring (still do). His ideas weren't bad--but they weren't at all in line with what I wanted to do. They were traditional--which is typically the exact opposite of what I want.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, no one got what they wanted--the company split back up into the original two groups, and within a year, both groups fell apart. Maybe we wouldn't have been successful even if we had stayed together. Can't really tell with that kind of thing.</p>
        <p>I don't regret sticking up for myself and my ideas. I trust my gut and my artistic sensibilities. But there is something I do regret: I initially agreed to compromise on some things that I internally knew I couldn't compromise on. Wouldn't. I thought that once things were more established, more real, I could convince this guy to see things from my perspective. Because I was so smart and charming, <a href="http://www.rankopedia.com/CandidatePix/99922.gif">you know</a>?</p>
        <p>That sounds pretty stupid now. If I could give any advice to past-Jordy, I'd tell him to be sincere when you're discussing what you want. Communicate. Be real. Be honest. You'll either get what you want, find a good compromise, or realize early on that things aren't going to work out. And any of those are less stressful and emotional than trying to force a merger between two groups with completely opposing values that aren't negotiable.</p>
        <p>But past-Jordy wasn't the brightest light on the Christmas tree. I'm not sure he would have listened. He probably needed the experience.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you've gotta blow off some fingers to know to be careful with fireworks.</p>
