      <p id="title">Reviewing 3 of My Most Used Sites</p>
      <p id="date"><em>08/31/2014</em></p>
      <div id="content">
<p><em><a href="reddit.com">Reddit</a></em></p>
<p>Alright--I know that Reddit has a reputation. And it's earned--some of the sub-reddits are cesspools of delusional crazies patting each other on the back. Totally.</p>
<p>But it's also a place where all of the content is community-chosen. It is, technically, the most democratic way a site can be run. There is information about, essentially, everything--and you can most definitely find a sub you're interested in. And I think that's pretty darn cool.</p>
<p>The site's aesthetic can be overwhelming for first-timers--there're about twenty sub-reddits being listed across the top of the page, eight different ways to filter the "front-page" content, and a side-bar with sign-in info and a giant add for Reddit Gold ("Whatever that is...", I hear every new-user thinking). However, at the end of the day, the eye is drawn to the content--so the design still accomplishes its goal.</p>
<p>It feels old-schoolâ€”seemingly organized, but in such a "specialist" way that it can be off-putting if you've never checked it out before--controlled chaos. "It's cluttered, but I know where everything is." Add to that a culture that can, very easily, feel exclusionary, and you've got a site that has a pretty high gate for potential new-users.</p>
<p>And that's sad to me--Reddit has a very cool potential--the content is, literally, on anything you could ask for. After getting through those initial "I'm not sure what I'm dealing with" feelings, I have found a site that is constantly evolving, always expressing a different idea (Because of that democratically controlled content). And perhaps that's part of the reason the site's aesthetic can't be reined in further--they never know what will be going on the front page.</p>
<p>I had to be careful while writing this section--because, wow--there's so much stuff to look at. Reddit might be the greatest time-suck of the Internet--and I say that knowing that the next site I'm looking at is...</p>

<p><em><a href="facebook.com">Facebook</a></p></em>
<p>Oh, Facebook. The Book of Faces. The "Libro de Caras". I hope I don't have to explain what it is.</p>
<p>Examining the Facebook page is tough--because it's constantly changing (A major user-complaint). But, if you're reading this in five hours and yours doesn't look like this anymore, just trust me. It's a four-column lay-out--the left side is awash in different utilities and groups you won't remember joining. Column two--99% of the reason you're on Facebook--the News Feed. Column three--listings of birthdays, events, and news you probably don't care about (But I sure was happy when they posted that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B16Bo47KS2g">trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy</a>.) And, FINALLY, (don't you feel a little exhausted?) there's an entire panel devoted to telling me who else is spending their work-day hours on Facebook.</p>
<p>If you can't tell, I'm not a big fan of Facebook's page. It's trying so hard to be modern, constantly updating, and all of that is really just alienating. And, while I'm betting Facebook doesn't have a lot of <em>new</em> users anymore, I can't imagine how overwhelming it would feel. Why do we need the chat column without prompting? Why are there two different links to Messages?</p>
<p>But here's the rub--I'm talking about Facebook's site because I use it. Often. Maybe not daily, (Because of the iPhone app) but still--pretty often. Why? Because it's constantly updated and it provides the easiest way I've found to keep in touch with people. And how else am I supposed to know when people I haven't talked to since high school are having babies?</p>
<p>Facebook, even worse than Buzzfeed or Clickhole, or any of those other click-bait monsters, is the fast food of the Internet. I don't know why I bother and I end up feeling gross after I've digested it.</p>

<p><em><a href="medium.com">Medium</a></em></p>
<p>And here we are--my current favorite site in all of the Internet. First--it's beautiful. A modern minimalism that allows you to absorb what's going on within seconds--<em>beautifully</em> responsive--change the width of your browser on here and the site adjusts without any trouble.</p>
<p>And the best part? Everything about the design is an answer to the question Medium set out to answer--"How can we provide the best medium (heh--see what I did there?) for people to read interesting, user-submitted articles?" And they are stupidly interesting--while sitting down to write this, I ended up bookmarking six articles. Wanna know how hard that was? Two clicks.</p>
<p>Medium makes content the supreme focus--and it does it elegantly. Articles are presented in a single column--instead of having a huge stream of comments at the bottom of the page, they're represented as a number to the right of the specific paragraph the comment is in reference to--click the number, read the comments. Simple. Streamlined. Sexy.</p>
<p>Not every article is great. But a lot of them are. The content is typically well-written and comes from a strong point of view that invites you to look at things from a new perspective.</p>
<p>Medium is the kind of site that accelerates your absorption of the material by presenting it in the simplest form. It's engaging because it provides a no-distraction zone in which to work with the articles. The site itself looks like a "distraction free" mode--but that's just how it works.</p>
<p>To put it simply--Medium strikes a balance between Reddit's content and Facebook's...well...I mean I don't have a lot of good to say for Facebook.</p>
<p>Either way--Medium is totally awesome, and if you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor.</p>
