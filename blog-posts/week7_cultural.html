      <p id="title">Hold On Tight</p>
      <p id="date">10/11/2014</p>
      <div id="content">
        <p>This week, I'm going to discuss values--the ones I hold dearest, and how I intend to use them to help me at DBC.</p>
        <p>The first value, the value that has probably been with me the longest, is the desire for intense challenge. I value challenge very highly--but I'm also picky about what I want to put my energy into. My positive feelings after accomplishing something almost always relate to how difficult the thing is--if it is easy, even if I do it "better" or "faster", I will not consider it any "great thing".</p>
        <p>But accomplishing the genuinely difficult--even when someone else does it "better"--that's where I get my most energy.</p>
        <p>The second value--and a very close second for me, is creativity. I want to figure out the smoothest--the coolest--the smartest way to accomplish something. To me, that's all about creativity--whether it's working in theatre or programming or writing, I always want my final product to be as slick as it can be.</p>
        <p>I try to live up to these values in everything I do. I don't alway succeed--and I went through a time in my life where the value of Challenge was so far from my sight that it's hard to not feel depressed about it. But we grow. And we evolve. And often that means coming back to who we were a long time ago--but wiser.</p>
        <p>And I often try to find ways to relate these values to people when I offer advice. I try to be creative in <em>how</em> I offer my advice--I want to express it in a way that doesn't sound tired or cliched. And I always encourage people to take up whatever challenge they're facing--because I believe they'll be more satisfied with their lives if they take more challenges upon themselves.</p>
        <p>I need to remember all of this while I'm at DBC. It's easy to forget your values when you're in the middle of something that intense--but they're also likely to be the only thing that's going to get you through it.</p>
