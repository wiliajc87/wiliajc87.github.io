<p>JavaScript. Sweet word, right? Sounds like a coffee shop for guys and gals working on their film scripts. Probably some money in that idea--I wonder if <a href="http://images.wikia.com/coffee/images/archive/7/74/20101112233800!Starbucks_logo.png">anyone has thought of it yet</a>?</p>
<p>But that isn't what JavaScript is. JavaScript is a programming language--and if <a href="http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/images/tech/781-programming-skills-change.png">this chart</a> is to be believed, it's one to be taken VERY seriously for any developer. That chart is displaying the growth of languages needed for developer jobs from 2012 to 2013. Pretty good for a language that first appeared on the scene in 1995, eh? Check out what <a href="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5256bc256bb3f7c43ab9fab7/this-is-what-amazon-looked-like-in-1995.jpg">Amazon.com</a> looked like in 1995 if you need some perspective on that.</p>
<p>Alright--now that we all feel properly old, let's look at the Pros of Javascript.</p>
<h2>--It's easy to produce.</h2>
<p>Really--all you need to make something in JavaScript is a text editor--and there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors">SO MANY</a>. A lot of them are free, too. A lot of languages need a "compiler"--a program that looks at your code and produces something. But JavaScript can be used by your web browser--so, assuming you're not reading via a plug in the back of your head, you've already got that covered. Pretty sweet Matrix reference, eh?</p>
<h2>--So. Many. Resources.</h2>
<p>There are a ton of libraries available for JavaScript, full of code written by people who just love the language and want to save you the trouble of figuring out the really tough stuff. I mean, <a href="http://designzum.com/2014/06/02/10-best-javascript-libraries-for-2014/">check this out</a>--that's just a list of things "for 2014". And they're doing crazy cool stuff!</p>
<p>But for every pro, there's probably a con, right? Let's look at a couple.</p>
<h2>--It won't always do what you want it to do.</h2>
<p>JavaScript, like I said earlier, is interpreted by browsers--not a compiler. This means that some browsers will do silly things with your code. So, that pro from earlier comes with a con. BUT, all this really means is you have to apply some diligence to testing it on the major browsers. Maybe that isn't fun, but if you want to guarantee that everyone can enjoy your super-awesome code, you're gonna have to take that step.</p>
<h2>--Some people are afraid of it.</h2>
<p>If that reference to 1995 from earlier made you feel as old as it made me feel, you probably remember when the Internet was even scarier than it is now--JavaScript was used by a lot of folks to create pop-up ads (not that they've really stopped, depending on where you go) and they would even go the extra step of making those ads loop--so you'd close one and get another, or if you stayed on the site long enough another one would come up. Super annoying. Almost as annoying as <a href="http://1.media.dorkly.cvcdn.com/60/47/662e0cdfcc9f7dc0941a40518e5090b6.jpg">this</a>. So, some folks have their browsers set to disable JavaScript. There's really nothing to do about this except throw a message up on your site letting people know they're not getting the full experience of your site unless they enable JavaScript. Hopefully they'll give it a try.</p>
<p>And, if you haven't, hopefully you'll give JavaScript a try too.</p>
