      <p id="title">Stereotype Threat</p>
      <p id="date">10/05/2014</p>
      <div id="content">
        <p>These week, something we've been examining at DBC is <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/">stereotype threat</a>.</p>
        <p>It's a difficult subject--because it's sensitive. It isn't fun to talk about. I don't even have a funny link to use for this post--that's how sensitive it is.</p>
        <p>As a white, heterosexual male in America, I haven't struggled much with sterotype threat. I certainly haven't dealt with it like a lot of people out there.</p>
        <p>The closest I can really say that I've come to experiencing stereotype threat was when I first moved to Chicago from West Texas.</p>
        <p>I didn't expect it at first, but it quickly became apparent to me that people assumed a lot about me once they realized I was from Texas. So I hesitated to tell them. It isn't that I'm ashamed of where I'm from--I'm not. It's that people have conceptions about what that means--and those conceptions don't necessarily describe me. People tend to assume, if you're from the South, that you're very religious and probably small-minded about topics like sexuality, racism, and women's rights. None of these things are true about me.</p>
        <p>I never lied about where I'm from--but I did, often, do my best to not bring it up.</p>
