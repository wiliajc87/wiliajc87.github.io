      <div id="content">
        <p>This week, I'm taking a look at myself. I know--crazy, right? "Sometimes you've gotta look in the mirror for something other than cutting your hair into a Mohawk." My grandmother said that. <a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3067/5862142840_872254fc19.jpg">Sweet lady</a>.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I'm looking at my thinking and learning styles--because it's important to look at, especially when you're embarking on a new experience like going to <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DBC</a>. And I was pretty impressed when I looked at my results of the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style Test</a>, because it was fairly spot-on. I am an "Abstract Random Learner"--and if that isn't the fanciest term you read today, you're a little too <a href="http://syn.org.au/sites/default/files/media/1340077576_The-English-Gentleman-by-Monocle.JPG">highfalutin</a> for me or this blog.</p>
        <p>Abstract Random Learners have been known to say <a href="http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~jgutliph/Books/learning_styles/Abstract_Random.html">these kinds of things</a>. And, *wow* those fit me like a well-tailored suit. I've always had a problem with being misinterpreted--namely, that I hate it. And I'm pretty anti-authority as well. And I'm not really competitive--unless we're playing <a href="http://www.coolest-toys.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/800px-stratego_board.jpg">Stratego</a>. Then I'm out for blood--little plastic soldier blood.</p>
        <p>But the thing that hit me the hardest? Abstract Random Learners don't do well with learning things when they don't see personal application. <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01428/bingo_1428487c.jpg">BINGO!</a> That is me to the ultimate degree. I was reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> yesterday and wanted to rip my eyes out after a couple of chapters--not because there is anything wrong with the book--Rather, it's excellently written and incredibly helpful. But at the beginning of this journey, I'm having a lot of trouble understanding the true application of things like "while loops". How does making a JavaScript function that produces the square root of any given number help me make the newest, coolest web application?</p>
        <p>I don't know yet. And it's driving me crazy. The only solution I've really come up with for this is to keep plugging away--trusting that it will all be worth it. It must be, right? Marijn Haverbeke wouldn't start his book off this way if it wasn't--I'm sure he's a nice guy. And DBC wouldn't have us reading it unless it was the right way to go. So, the real solution I've come up with is to have some humility and realize that I don't know what's required for this path. All I can do is trust that others do.</p>
        <p>Gotta grow that <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">mindset</a>. Gotta keep pushing--keep stretching. Without doing that, potential is limited.</p>
