<p>Let's all enjoy this ridiculous video before we get going, eh?</p>
<p>All good? Sure, watch it once more--it's legitimately hysterical.</p>
<p>The scary thing is, a decent chunk of the population thinks this is what happens when a system gets hacked. They imagine some nefarious individual sitting at a massive screen with three different keyboards, violently slamming at the keys as if they were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage">John Cage</a> having a seizure.</p>
<p>The truth is much more nefarious--one of the most common forms of hacking is something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29">"Social Engineering"</a> (Man that term does NOT indicate how frustrating it is). Social engineering is, to put it simply, "hacking" someone's account by manipulating people (ie lying) into getting the info you need. For instance--Kevin Mitnick, who's mentioned in the linked Wikipedia article, says that it was WAY easier to just trick people into giving him their password than actually bothering the "hack" it. They'll just call you--or they'll call the company that has the info they need--and they'll pretend to be someone who should have access to that info. It's that easy sometimes.</p>
<p>Security is a legitimately big deal for the tech industry--do a quick Google search of any of your favorite tech companies and you'll find <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-and-breaches/sony-hacked-again-1-million-passwords-exposed/d/d-id/1098113?">example</a> after <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/Microsoft-Xbox-hackers-576321">example</a> after <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/apple-admits-celebrity-accounts-hacked-but-denies-96471519984.html">example</a> of the "big guys" getting hacked in ways that sound ridiculous. Oh--and I hope you'll appreciate the fact that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/how-to/4-93-million-Gmail-accounts-hacked-Check-if-yours-is-safe/articleshow/42275951.cms">Google itself totally got hacked</a>.</p>
<p>There's a two-fold takeaway from this.</p>
<h2>--Do Your Part</h2>
<p>Maybe you don't know jack about tech or how the Internet works. You just want to be able to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgxL-PwmY7s">funny cat videos</a>, comment on your cousin's wedding photos (to make up for not going), and catch the newest episode of Dancing with the Stars (Or whatever is big now). And that's totally fine. But you've gotta put a little effort in to protecting yourself, alright?</p>
<p>I'm no expert at this kind of stuff--but <a href="https://creativewhim.com/6-tips-to-improve-internet-security/">this article</a> has a ton of great ideas. I could sum them up for you, but they wrote a really nice article on their own--why would I steal their thunder?</p>
<h2>--Expect Companies to Do Their Part</h2>
<p>Consider what companies you're relying on to keep your private stuff...ya know...PRIVATE. Do you really want to trust them? After something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2014_celebrity_photo_leaks">this happens</a>, the worldwide Internet using community is totally within its right to say, "Hey, could you guys see if maybe you're not doing enough to protect our shit? Maybe?"</p>
<p>It's something the tech community desperately needs to pay more attention to--because when we ask a user for a password, we're not JUST asking them for a password to our site. <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/04/23/users-same-password-most-websites/">55 percent of users use the same password for most, if not all, websites.</a> CONSIDER THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT PUTS ON YOU! It's nuts.</p>
<p>But that's what happens when you sign up to work in one of the coolest, most world-permeating industries in the history of history. Who was it who said something about great power bringing great responsibility? Oh, yeah--Spiderman's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben">Uncle Ben</a>. Seriously--if you won't listen to me, SURELY you'll listen to Uncle Ben.</p>
<p>Surely.</p>
