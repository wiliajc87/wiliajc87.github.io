_[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)_

Alright--I know that Reddit has a reputation. And it's earned--some of the sub-reddits are cesspools of delusional crazies patting each other on the back. Totally.

But it's also a place where all of the content is community-chosen. It is, technically, the most democratic way a site can be run. There is information about, essentially, everything--and you can most definitely find a sub you're interested in. And I think that's pretty darn cool.

The site's aesthetic can be overwhelming for first-timers--there're about twenty sub-reddits being listed across the top of the page, eight different ways to filter the "front-page" content, and a side-bar with sign-in info and a giant add for Reddit Gold ("Whatever that is...", I hear every new-user thinking). However, at the end of the day, the eye is drawn to the content--so the design still accomplishes its goal.

It feels old-schoolâ€”seemingly organized, but in such a "specialist" way that it can be off-putting if you've never checked it out before--controlled chaos. "It's cluttered, but I know where everything is." Add to that a culture that can, very easily, feel exclusionary, and you've got a site that has a pretty high gate for potential new-users.

And that's sad to me--Reddit has a very cool potential--the content is, literally, on anything you could ask for. After getting through those initial "I'm not sure what I'm dealing with" feelings, I have found a site that is constantly evolving, always expressing a different idea (Because of that democratically controlled content). And perhaps that's part of the reason the site's aesthetic can't be reined in further--they never know what will be going on the front page.

I had to be careful while writing this section--because, wow--there's so much stuff to look at. Reddit might be the greatest time-suck of the Internet--and I say that knowing that the next site I'm looking at is...

_[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)_

Oh, Facebook. The Book of Faces. The "Libro de Caras". I hope I don't have to explain what it is.

Examining the Facebook page is tough--because it's constantly changing (A major user-complaint). But, if you're reading this in five hours and yours doesn't look like this anymore, just trust me. It's a four-column lay-out--the left side is awash in different utilities and groups you won't remember joining. Column two--99% of the reason you're on Facebook--the News Feed. Column three--listings of birthdays, events, and news you probably don't care about (But I sure was happy when they posted that [trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B16Bo47KS2g).) And, FINALLY, (don't you feel a little exhausted?) there's an entire panel devoted to telling me who else is spending their work-day hours on Facebook.

If you can't tell, I'm not a big fan of Facebook's page. It's trying so hard to be modern, constantly updating, and all of that is really just alienating. And, while I'm betting Facebook doesn't have a lot of _new_ users anymore, I can't imagine how overwhelming it would feel. Why do we need the chat column without prompting? Why are there two different links to Messages?

But here's the rub--I'm talking about Facebook's site because I use it. Often. Maybe not daily, (Because of the iPhone app) but still--pretty often. Why? Because it's constantly updated and it provides the easiest way I've found to keep in touch with people. And how else am I supposed to know when people I haven't talked to since high school are having babies?

Facebook, even worse than Buzzfeed or Clickhole, or any of those other click-bait monsters, is the fast food of the Internet. I don't know why I bother and I end up feeling gross after I've digested it.

_[Medium](https://www.medium.com)_

And here we are--my current favorite site in all of the Internet. First--it's beautiful. A modern minimalism that allows you to absorb what's going on within seconds--_beautifully_ responsive--change the width of your browser on here and the site adjusts without any trouble.

And the best part? Everything about the design is an answer to the question Medium set out to answer--"How can we provide the best medium (heh--see what I did there?) for people to read interesting, user-submitted articles?" And they are stupidly interesting--while sitting down to write this, I ended up bookmarking six articles. Wanna know how hard that was? Two clicks.

Medium makes content the supreme focus--and it does it elegantly. Articles are presented in a single column--instead of having a huge stream of comments at the bottom of the page, they're represented as a number to the right of the specific paragraph the comment is in reference to--click the number, read the comments. Simple. Streamlined. Sexy.

Not every article is great. But a lot of them are. The content is typically well-written and comes from a strong point of view that invites you to look at things from a new perspective.

Medium is the kind of site that accelerates your absorption of the material by presenting it in the simplest form. It's engaging because it provides a no-distraction zone in which to work with the articles. The site itself looks like a "distraction free" mode--but that's just how it works.

To put it simply--Medium strikes a balance between Reddit's content and Facebook's...well...I mean I don't have a lot of good to say for Facebook.

Either way--Medium is totally awesome, and if you haven't checked it out, do yourself a favor.
